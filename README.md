# PROJECT-3
The notebook explores the COVID-19 data provided, focusing on Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia. It provides insights into the trends and variations in confirmed cases, fatalities, and recoveries for each country.

The notebook starts by loading the data and creating a DataFrame. It then plots a line graph to visualize the rise in confirmed cases across regions for each country. The plot includes insights for each region, such as the number of cases at specific indices.

Next, the notebook plots the recovery cases across regions for each country. It observes a steady rise in recovery cases with some fluctuations in Nigeria, a fluctuating pattern with a substantial increase in recoveries in South Africa, and a gradual rise in recovery cases with a consistent trend in Kenya.

The notebook then focuses on fatality cases, plotting them across regions for each country. It observes significant fatalities in South Africa and highlights this using annotations.

To summarize the data, the notebook calculates the mean and standard deviation of confirmed cases and fatalities. It also splits the data into training and test sets for further analysis.

Finally, the notebook calculates the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the confidence interval for the predicted values.

The notebook provides a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 data, presenting insights into the trends and variations observed in confirmed cases, fatalities, and recoveries for the selected countries.
